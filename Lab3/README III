we have one node that subscribes to laser scan data and publishes to a Twist message. It also contains a function called 'callback_laser' which is called 
when a new laser scan message is received.The function takes the laser scan data and checks the state for the robot to be in. 
The robot can be in one of five states:
   1.find the wall
   2.turn left
   3.turn right
   4.back
   5.follow the wall
It does this by checking the ranges of the laser scan data in three regions with certain range of angles in the front, left, and right of the robot. Based 
on the minimum range in these regions, the function decide which state the robot should be in. The function then calls the 'change_state' function to 
change the state and publish a Twist message to control the robot's movement,after changing state we will maintain some constant distance between wall and 
robot,so that it won't miss the path.The 'plot_laser' function plots the laser scan data in a polar plot, which is useful for visualizing the data. The 
'take_action' function determines which action the robot should take based on its current state.
